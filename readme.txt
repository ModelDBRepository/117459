This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Cruz GE, Sahley CL, Muller KJ (2007) Neuronal competition for action
potential initiation sites in a circuit controlling simple
learning. Neuroscience 148:65-81

Each model in a folder corresponds to an experiment in the paper,
particularly relative refractory periods with and without 5-HT.  The
2-cell model emulates the electrophysiology and the 3-cell model is a
"biological" representation including synaptic input.

These model files were supplied by Dr Ginny Cruz.
